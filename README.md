# ai_searching_algorithms

This is a university project. Here you can use breadth, depth, best, astar to find a path 
from a number a to a bigger number b.

Check out definitions.h to roughly figure out the logic used in the algorithms.
The heuristic function for best and astar is also admissible (distance/4).
I could not find the best heuristic function for best/astar.
